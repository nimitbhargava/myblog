I work as a Full Stack Developer (take up anything for building the product).

My interest lies in building products that impact the mass and helps in solving real-world problems. 
I am always open to contribute on open-source projects in any way possible.


Apart from working, I like to travel and listen to music from around the world. 

I use base Jekyll theme for building the blog. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
